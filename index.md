I am a Senior ML Engineer at [Coupang Play](https://www.coupangplay.com/), building the video recommendation system for the most popular streaming service in South Korea.

Previously, I received an undergraduate and a masterâ€™s degree in computer science from UCLA. I was a research assistant at the UCLA NLP Lab, where I worked with [Wasi Ahmad](https://wasiahmad.github.io/) and [Kai-Wei Chang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/).

I've also spent time recommending jobs at [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/), deploying a log monitoring tool at [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/), and building the checkout page at [Ticketmaster](https://www.ticketmaster.com/).
