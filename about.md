I am a Senior ML Engineer at Coupang Play, building the video recommendation system for the most popular streaming service in Korea. 

Previously, I received an undergraduate and a masterâ€™s degree in computer science from UCLA. I was a research assistant at the UCLA NLP Lab, where I worked with [Wasi Ahmad](https://wasiahmad.github.io/) and [Kai-Wei Chang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/). I've also spent time at LinkedIn, PayPal, and Ticketmaster.
