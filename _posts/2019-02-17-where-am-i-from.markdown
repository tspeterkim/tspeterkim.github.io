It's not a trick question. It's something that I've always been confused about since I was a child. To this day, I don't really know the right answer. But I've thought that drawing out a timeline might make it easier to grasp at this usually innocent question. Here's my definitive (but not really) answer:

{% include timeline-v2.html %}

<br>
Pretty long answer, right? To get a better sense of everything time-wise, let me use some graphs (I never thought that bar graphs and piecharts would become this useful to describe my personal identity):

![my-crazy-timeline](/images/02-17-19/timeline.png){: .center-image }
<br><b>My crazy timeline. You tell me where I'm from.</b>

![in-out-korea](/images/02-17-19/in-out-korea.png){: .center-image }
<br><b>I am "Korean" - # of years I lived in each continent</b>

As you can tell, even though I was born here and am ethnically Korean, I am culturally American (There's a reason why I am writing my blog posts in English). However, that's not even entirely true. I say American because it's the closest thing that I can identify to. I only recently came and left the U.S. for college and graduate school and, looking at the piechart above, it would seem like I would be more culturally European (whatever that means). Yet, I went to an International school when I lived abroad in these European nations, speaking English and befriending mostly American friends.

I think the most apparent reason why I feel culturally American is simply because I stayed there the longest compared to anywhere else. Looking at the timeline, you can see the longest I've ever stayed in one place was 5.5 years in LA - this is 2 years longer than the runner-up of 3.5 years in Brussels during my high-school years. Considering that my average occupation time in each of these countries is 2.6 years, living in LA for that long has certainly been an outlier (to be precise, at least 2 std dev. away). And consistency goes a long way - coupled with the prior expectation that I would stay in LA for at least 4 long years to finish my undergrad, I settled into the American ways of life much more comfortably and easily than anywhere I've lived before.

To be honest, I'm not trying to come to any grand conclusion about myself. Like many things in life, this question about my identity raises more questions than clear answers (so ask away down below in the comments).
